## Key Components

### Models
- **UploadSession**: Tracks file upload sessions and processing state
- **Product**: Sample model for testing (products catalog)
- **Customer**: Sample model for testing (customer records)

### Utilities
- **ModelIntrospector**: Dynamically discovers and analyzes Django models
- **FileProcessor**: Handles CSV/Excel file reading and processing
- **FieldMapper**: Suggests intelligent field mappings

### Features in Detail

#### Dynamic Model Discovery
The application automatically discovers all Django models in your project and presents them for selection. System models (auth, admin, etc.) are filtered out by default.

#### Field Type Validation
Supports validation for various Django field types:
- CharField, TextField (with max_length validation)
- IntegerField, FloatField, DecimalField
- BooleanField
- DateField, DateTimeField
- EmailField (with format validation)
- Fields with choices

#### Error Reporting
Invalid records are captured with detailed error information:
- Row number
- Field name
- Invalid value
- Specific error message

## Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`sample_products.csv`) is included for testing the Product model. It contains 10 product records with various field types.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Django 4.2+
- pandas
- openpyxl (for Excel support)
- xlrd (for older Excel formats)

## Development

### Adding New Models
Simply create new models in any Django app, run migrations, and they'll automatically appear in the model selection.

### Customizing Field Mapping Logic
Edit the `FieldMapper.suggest_mappings()` method in `mapper/utils.py` to customize the mapping suggestion algorithm.

### Extending File Format Support
The `FileProcessor` class in `mapper/utils.py` can be extended to support additional file formats.
